# DSA-PRACTICE
Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice repository**!  
This repo is where I solve problems from **LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, and other platforms** to strengthen my problem-solving and coding skills.  

ðŸš€ Goals
- Build strong foundations in **DSA + problem-solving**.
- Prepare for **SDE interviews & coding contests**.
- Write **clean, optimized, and well-documented code**.
- Track my **progress & consistency**.
